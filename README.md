# Welcome!

Feel free to take a look at the problems I've added so far. Keep your solutions contained in the folder. Feel free to ask any questions.

## Github stuff

The main branch is PR protected. That means that you won't be able to push up changes to main from your local repository to the origin. GitHub will reject it. So instead, you will need to create a working branch for your changes. Once you're ready, you can create a PR from your working branch to main and we'll go through a full code review process. Once that's approved, we can merge it in, bing bang boom. 

Let me know if you have questions and good luck! I'll add more problems here as I can. :)
